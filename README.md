# Landing Page Project

## Project Scope

This Landing Page project is for Udacity's front end nanodegree program. Burner CSS and html code was provided by the course. I have implemented a navigation panel that smoothly scrolls the user to the relative section in the landing page.

## Instructions for Running Project

To run this project, simply download the folder and open the index.html file in a browser. The index.html file is located in the root directory of the project.
